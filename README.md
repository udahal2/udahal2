
# Hi, I'm Ujwol. Thanks for your visit here. 👋


This is a page for my personal stuffs where I mostly handwrite everything. 


# I am a computer science student, general programmer and a researcher. 💻📚
I have a academic background with BE in electronics and Masters in Computer Science. I am not that hardcore CS major or an engineer either , but somehow a mix of both. I prefer to build practical applications.
### 🐍 Also a Pythonic Developer with a passion for AI and Machine Learning and also some more! 🚀

 With so much more going around on digital world ; exploring anything is easier than ever before.


🔭 I’m currently working on:
- Building AI models.
- Exploring deep learning and reinforcement learning techniques
- Reading and try contributing to AI research projects

👨‍💻 I am a proud tech fan and my skills hover around:
- Python programming and scripting
- Machine Learning & Deep Learning (PyTorch, Keras)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP), Hugging Face 
- Computer Vision
- Webapp Development (Flask, Django, Fastapi)
- Data Analysis and Visualization (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Algorithms and Data Structures


🌱 I’m currently learning:
- Automation Projects for custom usecases.
- Reinforcement Learning
- Well, some big data of course (pyspark)

💬 I like talking about:
- AI, ML, and Data Science
- Python best practices and libraries
- Solving complex problems with efficient algorithms
- Tips for improving coding productivity
- Some philosophical talks ; something which like abstract but makes sense.
- Brainstorming sometimes.

### 🎸 Acoustic Fingerstyle Guitar Enthusiast🔥:
Playing the acoustic fingerstyle guitar has been a thrilling adventure for me. It brings me immense pleasure and peace, a hobby I never imagined loving so much while growing up. Strumming the strings and exploring new melodies has become a beautiful part of my life. I am not that fluent in this yet but seems like this one is going to last long. Though it is not so convinient to have long nails and and a somehow rusty left fingertips; the rewards with muscle memory and neurological balance are really awesome. Ping me if you are interested in this one too. 

### 🎯 Fun Fact:
I love exploring new technologies and applying them to solve real-world problems. When I'm not coding, you will most probably find me playing the guitar or watching someone play it or just listen to it.
