Welcome to my personal page where I share a part of my journey through words. 
This is primarily intended for my work portfolio.

## About Me 💻📚

I’m a **contract-based software engineer** with a  academic background in **Electronics Engineering** and a **Master’s in Computer Science**. I'm a unique mix of practical problem solver and theorist, focused on building real-world applications. 

I specialize in:
- **Python Development** (scripting, automation, and full-stack development)
- **AI & Machine Learning** (with a passion for Reinforcement Learning , Deep Learning , and NLP)
- **Web Application Development** (Flask, Django, FastAPI)
- **Data Science** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and deep data analytics)
- **Computer Vision** (working on exciting projects with image and video processing)

### 🌱 Currently Learning:
- **Advanced Automation** (working on building custom automation tools that are scalable and can be used as independent software for various use cases.)
- **General Computer Science and AI with Reinforcement Learning** (I’m diving deep into algorithms that drive autonomous agents)
- **Big Data** (working with PySpark to process and analyze large datasets specially image datasets and texts.)
- **AI Model Deployment** (looking into tools for deploying models into production)

### 🚀 My Current Focus:
- Building AI models that can be integrated into real-world applications.
- Developing scalable **machine learning** pipelines.
- Contributing to **open-source projects** and AI research.
- Developing **automation tools** that can handle customized use-cases for clients.
- Developing customized creator tools that focuses on creating projects.

🎸 Acoustic Fingerstyle Guitar Enthusiast🔥:
Playing the acoustic fingerstyle guitar has been a thrilling adventure for me. It brings me immense pleasure and peace, a hobby I never imagined loving so much while growing up. Strumming the strings and exploring new melodies has become a beautiful part of my life. I am not that fluent in this yet but seems like this one is going to last long. Though it is not so convinient to have long nails and and a somehow rusty left fingertips; the rewards with muscle memory and neurological balance are really awesome. Ping me if you are interested in this one too.

🎯 Fun Fact:
I love exploring new technologies and applying them to solve real-world problems. When I’m not coding, you will most probably find me playing the guitar or watching someone play it or just listen to it.
